Subject: Sleep until tapped, then cycle some numbers on the LED for a while.

This is a demonstration of the LED display code, and a proof that the
tap wakeup code works.




TODO FIXME: Use OC0A and OC0B for display selection.  That will allow us to
use the PWM features of timer 0.  Luckily, OC0B is on PA7, so masking out
the decimal point (which was on PA7) is easy.  OC0A is on PB2, so move the
DP out of the way.  Move the DP to one of PB0 or PB1, and tap detection to
the other.

The timer 0 overflow interrupt handler will have to mangle the DDR bits to select between the displays.  (That, or mangle the COM0xn bits, but DDR seems quicker and easier.)
