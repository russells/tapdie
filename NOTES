Random notes.

- Power from a 3V CR2032 Lithium cell.

- Use the ATtiny84/V or ATtiny84A.  Both will work down to 1.8V at up to 4MHz.

- The default 1Hz internal clock should be more than sufficient, and there's no
  need for great timing accuracy.

- Power down current for those MCUs is less than 1uA.

- When in power down mode, turn off all the peripherals.  Wake only on a pin
  change interrupt.  I have confirmed that this uses very little current, with
  the cat toy project.

- Display will be two 7 segment LED displays.  That needs 10 pins - seven
  segments plus the decimal point, plus two display select pins.

- The display can be multiplexed with a timer interrupt, and the display
  brightness can be changed in the interrupt using PWM mode (change the OCRnx
  value in the interrupt).

- The display select pins will need buffer transistors, partly to avoid the
  maximum source/sink current, and partly to prevent the display brightness
  varying depending on the number of segments lit.

- Add in the pin needed for the piezo (for both knock detection and beeping)
  and that just leaves the reset pin vacant.  Not a pin to spare!

- Try to fit in the smallest ABS case with a clear lid, for example the
  Altronics H0320 (65x60x40mm.)
