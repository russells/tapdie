A die that you tap on the table to roll.

Features:

- Generates a random number and shows that on a display.

- Can operate in several die modes - D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20 and D100.

- Does not need a power switch, so it can be in a a sealed container.

Operation:

- If it's off, one tap turns it on.  It shows you the current maximum number
  it's set for, one of ' 4', ' 6'. '10', '12', '20', or '00' (meaning 100).

- After a short while the die will do a roll, showing a short series of
  random numbers from 1 up to the current maximum, then it will stop on a
  random number.

- After the roll, the die will briefly display the maximum roll again, then
  pause, then show the random number.  After another pause, it will start
  fading in and out, showing the maximum while fading out, and the random
  number while fading in.  After doing that for a few seconds, it will fade
  out completely.

- While displaying the random number, a single tap will start the roll
  again.  More than one tap in quick succession will change the maximum
  roll.

- While doing the roll, another tap will restart and lengthen the roll, up
  to a maximum length.

- While displaying the random number, the right decimal point is on.  While
  displaying either the maximum or the numbers during the roll process, the
  decimal points are off so we can definitely tell the random number apart
  from other numbers that are displayed.
